* Phase 1: Registration
  1. Entering emails (an email should be verified whether it is real or not)
  2. Entering the pwds (insert pwd twice)
  3. The data will be saved in a user table (Name,
First Name, Email, pwd (hashed)) from your Database.
Phase 2: Authentication:
a- Authentication could be double factor (verification
with comics)
A- Give your email:
B- Give your password (ind. Your password will not be
not display)
Phase 3: Menu ()
1- Coding and decoding of a message

a- Coding
b- Decoding
2- Hash of a message
a-Md5
b-SHA1
c- SHA256
3 - Cracking a hashed message
a-Md5
b-SHA1
c- SHA256
4 - Symmetric encryption and decryption of a message
Has
b- AES256

5 - Asymmetric encryption and decryption of a message

a- RSA
b- Elgamal

6 - Secure communication between two clients (ChatRoom)
7 - Exit
- The Python language is recommended.
- Suppose that user passwords are
present as follows: Last name.First name@insat.ucar.tn, with by
example Last name on 6 characters and first name on 5 characters,
and a fixed part ‘@insat.ucar.tn’. Generate a
insat.dic data dictionary with crunch command
to meet these constraints.
You are led in step 2 of your menu to insert a
email to hash so you can crack the hash of
this email in step 3 based on the dictionary
insat.dic.
- For secure communication, it relies on
sockets between two terminals to simulate a chat room
secure with each other. Choosing the encryption method
messages exchanged is free.
